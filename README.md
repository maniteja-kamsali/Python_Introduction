#Python_Introduction

In this repository I have used different basic concepts of python

*List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list*.
Syntax:
```
newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
```
*A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.*
Syntax:
```java script
lambda arguments : expression
```
